# Approver Guide

The following guide is meant for authorized Themerr approvers to use when approving theme submissions.

## Process

- [ ]  Open the issue on GitHub

- [ ]  Inspect the issue title

- It should have the theme type in brackets.
> Valid types are "MOVIE", "MOVIE COLLECTION", "TV SHOW", "GAME", "GAME COLLECTION", "GAME FRANCHISE"
-  The title of the item should follow it. If it is a Movie, TV Show, or Game, it will have the year in parenthesis. Collections and Franchises will not have the year.

- [ ]  Check if the issue has an exception
- An exception is indicated a couple ways:

First is an exception comment

  ![exception1](../docs/images/exception1.png)

Second is a label that is added to the issue

  ![exception2](../docs/images/exception2.png)

- If there are exceptions, we cannot add the theme. Usually it's due to a regional block or age restriction on the video they submitted. We need to direct the user to correct it by editing their original submission.

- [ ]  Check if the issue is a duplicate submission
- An duplicate submission is indicated by a label:


- Duplicate submissions modify themes currently in the database and need to be investigated with more scrutiny as we don't want to accidentally overwrite a good theme with a lower quality theme.
- If an issue is marked as a duplicate, check the reason for the theme change in the user's submission, then determine if the theme is better than the present one and meets our criteria for theme submissions.

> If there is no reason given, the issue can be closed.

- [ ] Check the contents of the comment from LizardByte-Bot
Specifically check the git diff.

- `okay.diff` below is an example of one that is okay to add. Basically, if there are new files added, this is a good sign! Lots of green is good!

  ![okay](../docs/images/okay.diff)

- `do_not_add.diff` below is an example of one that is not okay to add. Why do we not add it? Because the youtube_theme_url did not change... so basically they have submitted an edit to an item already in the library, but they left the theme the same as the one we already have.

  ![not_okay](../docs/images/do_not_add.diff)

`modified.diff` below is an example of a diff where the theme was edited. Modified themes need to be investigated with more scrutiny as we don't want to accidentally overwrite a good theme with a lower quality theme.
