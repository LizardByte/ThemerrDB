# Approver Guide

The following guide is meant for authorized Themerr approvers to use when approving theme submissions.

## Process

- [ ]  Open the issue on GitHub

- [ ]  Inspect the issue title

- It should have the type in brackets.
> Valid types are "MOVIE", "MOVIE COLLECTION", "TV SHOW", "GAME", "GAME COLLECTION", "GAME FRANCHISE"
-  The title of the item should follow it. If it is a Movie, TV Show, or Game, it will have the year in parenthesis. Collections and Franchises will not have the year.

- [ ]  Check if the issue has an exception or is a duplicate
- An exception is indicated a few ways. First is the comment, and second is a label that is added.
- If there are exceptions, we cannot add the theme, and we need to direct the user to correct it. Usually it's due to a regional block or age restriction on the video they submitted... have them edit the issue with a new url.
