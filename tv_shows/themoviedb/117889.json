So when his home PC flashes a message about him being summoned to another world, Yuji restarts his machine\u2026only to find that he\u2019s inadvertently accepted the summons! Now in a fantasy world far removed from paperwork and computers, Yuji has just one thing on his mind: waking up from what he thinks is a dream and getting back to the mountain of work he left behind! But this other world has other plans for Yuji, who quickly discovers his Monster Tamer character class allows him to befriend slimes! And thanks to their number, those slimes help him absorb so much magical knowledge that he gains a second character class in the blink of an eye! How will Yuji wield his power now that he\u2019s the greatest sage the realm has ever known?! And what about all that paperwork?!",
