Our team must find a way to return all the anachronisms to their original timelines before the time stream falls apart. But before our Legends can jump back into action, Rip Hunter and his newly established Time Bureau call their methods into question and disband the team. Challenging the Time Bureau\u2019s authority, they recruit a hacker from the future, Zari Tomaz and continue their time travelling shenanigans, while insisting that however messy their methods may be, some problems are beyond the Bureau\u2019s capabilities. Some problems can only be fixed by Legends.",
