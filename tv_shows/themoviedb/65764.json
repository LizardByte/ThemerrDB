The protagonist, Tooru Kokonoe (sometimes \u201cTor\u201d), enrolls in the academy driven by tragedy: his younger sister was killed, and he wants to gain power to protect others and possibly avenge her. On entering, Tooru discovers that his Blaze is not a typical weapon \u2014 instead of a sword, lance or gun like many classmates, his Blaze takes the form of a shield, making him an \u201cIrregular\u201d. Koryo Academy uses a system called Duo \u2014 every student is paired with a partner (their \u201cDuo\u201d), who they train, live, and fight together with. Tooru is paired with Julie Sigtuna, a silver\u2011haired girl from Scandinavia and a very capable fighter.",
