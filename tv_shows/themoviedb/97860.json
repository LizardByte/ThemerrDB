But when Rachel says she must leave him to climb the Tower, his world shatters around him. Vowing to follow after her no matter what it takes, he sets his sight on the tower, and a miracle occurs.\n\nThus begins the journey of Bam, a young boy who was not chosen by the Tower but opened its gates by himself. They call his kind \"Irregulars\"\u2014beings that have shaken the very foundation of the Tower each time they set foot inside it.",
