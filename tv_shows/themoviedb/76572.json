Once he stole the secret lore of the Inner Sect to reach the pinnacle of his art, his only way out was death. But after throwing himself off the deadly Hell's Peak he was reborn in a different world, the world of Douluo Dalu, a world where every person has a spirit of their own, and those with powerful spirits can practice their spirit power to rise and become Spirit Masters.\n\nThe spirit that awakens within Tang San is Blue Silver Grass, a useless spirit. Can he overcome the difficulties to reach the high ranks of Spirit Masters and bring the glory of the Tang Sect into this new world?",

Instead, he came to another world with another identity, a world belonging to the spirit of martial arts, named Douluo mainland. There is no magic, no fighting spirit, no martial arts, but there is a magical martial spirit. Everyone here, when he was six years old, would awaken his spirit in the spirit hall. Wuhun has animals, plants, and utensils. Wuhun can assist people in their daily lives. However, some of the outstanding spirits can be used to cultivate and fight. This profession is the most powerful and glorious profession \"soul master\" on the Douluo Continent.",
