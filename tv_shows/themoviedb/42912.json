The last goal was scored by Matsukaze Tenma, Shindou Takuto, and Tsurugi Kyousuke using The Earth \u221e. The cosmic plasma photon cannon didn't succeed in stopping the black hole at first, it fell back but Earth Eleven kicked it back to the black hole as their last kick towards tomorrow. Potomuri Emnator's spirit left Mizukawa Minori's body and disappeared, together with Acrous Obies and Sarjes Rugu. Earth Eleven were given a flower crown by Lalaya Obies as a reward for saving the galaxy. Kuroiwa Ryuusei was seen looking at Earth Eleven leaving Faram Obius and then smiled and was teleported into an unknown spaceship. Earth Eleven then finally came back to Earth.",
