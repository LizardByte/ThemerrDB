However, his true intention is to gather intelligence on politician Donovan Desmond, who only appears rarely in public at his sons' school. Enlisting with the help of city hall clerk Yor Briar to act as his wife and adopting the six-year-old orphan Anya as his daughter, Loid enacts his plan. He will enroll Anya in the same school, where Loid hopes she will excel and give him the opportunity to meet Donovan.\n\nUnfortunately, even a man of his talents has trouble playing the figure of a loving father and husband. And just like Loid is hiding his true identity, Yor\u2014who is an underground assassin\u2014and Anya\u2014an esper\u2014have no plans to disclose their own secrets either.",

Although they hide the truth from each other, this pretense of a perfectly ordinary family provides Anya with the genuine love and warmth that she longed for as an orphan.\n\nOperation Strix\u2014Loid's special mission to avoid potential war by gathering vital information and getting close to the powerful political figure, Donovan Desmond\u2014is only possible if Anya plays her part right. She can either excel academically and become an Imperial Scholar at her prestigious school or make friends with Donovan's son, Damian. Neither is exactly easy, but with her adventurous attitude, Anya throws herself wholeheartedly into her mission as a Forger\u2014all for the sake of international peace.",

Still the only one aware of everyone's true identities, Anya tries to sustain the family's cohesion while working to befriend Donovan's son Damian, her Eden Academy classmate.\n\nHowever, Anya's efforts instead earn her another Tonitrus Bolt, bringing her closer to getting expelled and jeopardizing the operation's success. Hearing the news, Loid faints from shock. In his unconsciousness, he reminisces about his tragic past and his journey to becoming a spy. Realizing what Operation Strix means to him and the world, Loid finds renewed motivation. Although they each work toward their own covert goals, the Forgers continue to cherish their chaotic yet blissful family life.",
