Ifurita comes again to itself and tries, the contrary to taxes, but in the reason, only Makoto yet can delay the chaos.  Together with rune, it goes into the reactor.  There a dimension hole to its normal world opens itself.  And in that, it goes while rune remains Venus.  The eye returns into its normal orbit, and Jinnai brings the single time in the 26 sequences a couple of words friendly (to Ifurita) over its lips.  Rune is alone and depressed and broods before itself there.  Seen turn therefrom the persons of el Hazard slowly to its normal life back.  Fujisawa climbs each attainable mountain, and Miz Mishtal hopes that it finally marries it.  Jinnai hatches again conquest plans, of which Diva is enthused.  And then Makoto is all at once again there - for always.",

    "overview": "Makoto Mizuhara is working on his latest experiment in the school science lab, but when he takes a break his lifelong rival Katsuhiko Jinnai shows up and attempts to destroy the device and discredit Makoto. This overloads the experiment and transports Makoto, Jinnai, his sister Nanami, and their teacher Mr. Fujisawa to the strange and magnificent world El Hazard. Makoto and Fujisawa land squarely in the Kingdom of Roshtaria, and quickly befriend the princess Rune Venus. Jinnai allies himself with the Bugrom, a race of giant insects bent on taking over El Hazard, while his sister tries to eke out her own living in the desert. Makoto searches desperately for a way to return home, all the while fighting off the Bugrom, enlisting the help of the Holy Priestesses, and stopping the demon god Ifurita from destroying everything.",
