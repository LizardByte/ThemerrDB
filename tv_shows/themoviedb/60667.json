At the venue, Fumina meets up with Mr. Ral and with Yuuma, who has come for a Gunpla building showdown with Minato. Many of the rivals they previously fought in the regional qualifiers and the national tournament have also gathered here. The Meijin Cup awards ceremony begins, and Yuuma\u2019s entry wins the Open Course category. As Fumina congratulates Yuuma on his prize, Sekai returns from his training trip.
