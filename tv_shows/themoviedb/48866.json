Despite their best efforts, war appeared unavoidable, until a new, even more dangerous threat \u2013 one that had been quietly rising all along \u2013 exploded to the surface: ALIE, the A.I. that ended the world, offered relief from pain and eternal life in the \u201cCity of Light.\u201d But as her ranks grew, it quickly became clear that she was building an army dedicated to controlling all sentient life on Earth. This was no longer a battle between warring factions; it was a fight for humanity itself. Now, a hard truth lands on the shoulders of those who remain. Will they go quietly into the night, or will they find hope and faith in each other, as they face their darkest chapter yet?",
