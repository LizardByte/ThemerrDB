However, the reality is less than ideal. Four classes, A through D, are ranked in order of merit, and only the top classes receive favorable treatment.\n\nKiyotaka Ayanokouji is a student of Class D, where the school dumps its worst. There he meets the unsociable Suzune Horikita, who believes she was placed in Class D by mistake and desires to climb all the way to Class A, and the seemingly amicable class idol Kikyou Kushida, whose aim is to make as many friends as possible.\n\nWhile class membership is permanent, class rankings are not; students in lower ranked classes can rise in rankings if they score better than those in the top ones. Additionally, in Class D, there are no bars on what methods can be used to get ahead. In this cutthroat school, can they prevail against the odds and reach the top?",

Angered by the previous test's outcome, Ryuuen is dead set on outdoing every class in the new challenge using any means necessary. Meanwhile, Karuizawa, a crucial pillar of Class D, is close to crumbling under the pressure of her past.\n\nThe stage is now set for Kiyotaka Ayanokouji to once again\u2014using the full extent of his planning, foresight, and ruthless manipulation\u2014steer Class D to victory as dangerously close enemy forces try to bring it down.",

They have to cooperate with students from classes with whom they had been competing against each other as enemies to obtain a high score. Above all, they are horrified by the rule that students from groups that fail to reach the borderline will be expelled.\n\nThe curtain on the turbulent third semester of the school year is about to rise!",
