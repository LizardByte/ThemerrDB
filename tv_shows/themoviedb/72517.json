Angered by the previous test's outcome, Ryuuen is dead set on outdoing every class in the new challenge using any means necessary. Meanwhile, Karuizawa, a crucial pillar of Class D, is close to crumbling under the pressure of her past. The stage is now set for Kiyotaka Ayanokouji to once again\u2014using the full extent of his planning, foresight, and ruthless manipulation\u2014steer Class D to victory as dangerously close enemy forces try to bring it down.",

As the name implies, the test is divided by gender, and several groups are made up of mixed classes and graded based on a group basis. They have to cooperate with students from classes with whom they had been competing against each other as enemies to obtain a high score. Above all, they are horrified by the rule that students from groups that fail to reach the borderline will be expelled.\n\nThe curtain on the turbulent third semester of the school year is about to rise!",
