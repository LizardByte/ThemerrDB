As she hurls herself headlong at modern living, Fleabag is thrown roughly up against the walls of contemporary London, with all its frenetic energy, late nights, and bright lights, in this very modern mix of fatalism and hedonism, sustaining a merry-go-round of broken dreamers. By turns hilarious and heartbreaking, this is the thoroughly disarming confessional of a woman so totally detached, she\u2019s utterly lost, and ultimately wondering what the hell she ought to be doing in life. Much like the rest of us.",

There, she meets a Catholic priest who turns her life upside down\u2026 Series 2 is an exploration into everything that makes us human: love, religion, hope and heartbreak.",
