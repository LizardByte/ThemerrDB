Meanwhile, the actions of Yuki and Uryu have caused a domino effect that has changed the future of almost every diary holder for the better. When Balks reads about his other self's death in Yuki's diary using his incomplete Watcher Diary, he calls off his partnership with Deus, who decides to cancel the survival game and find another method to determine his successor. Yuki manages to remember Yuno and break free from the illusionary world, in the process releasing his world's Murmur, who had been trapped by her first world self in order to impersonate her. Faced with Yuki's love and her other self's united family, Yuno's resolve to kill them all is lost, and she decides to commit suicide. A horrified Yuki is declared winner of the survival game by his world's Murmur and spirited away through a vortex. 10,000 years on, Yuki is still grieving Yuno's death in his now empty universe, refusing to create anything. At the end of the episode, the final entry in his diary changes from \"Yuno died\" to \"Yuno came to see me\", and her voice is heard calling his name.",
