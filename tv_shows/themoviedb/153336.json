As I was rolling around in a pigsty covered in mud, Jess, a kind, angelic, beautiful girl, came to my rescue. \"Oink!!\" \"Um, you don't have to force yourself to talk. I'm able to... understand you.\" This girl who was devotedly caring after my pig-self was a member of the Yethma, and her people have the ability to read minds. \"This is bad! That means she can see through all of my lustful delusions!\" Now in Mesteria, a world run by swords and magic, a pig and a mind-reading beauty set off on their lovey-dovey fantasy adventure! ... Or do they?",
