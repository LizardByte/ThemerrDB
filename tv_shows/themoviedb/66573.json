It is absolutely perfect. The only problem is Eleanor isn\u2019t supposed to be in The Good Place. In fact, her life decisions wouldn\u2019t have even gotten her close. But due to a clerical error, she\u2019s been given someone else\u2019s reward and now has to struggle with being good in order to make sure her secret isn\u2019t discovered.",

With a snap of her fingers, the Judge sent the humans back to Earth, in a new timeline where they never died. Also seeking redemption, along with Eleanor, are Senegalese philosopher Chidi Anagonye, who is tortured by decision-making; elegant Pakistani-British socialite Tahani Al-Jamil, and dance-obsessed Floridian Jason Mendoza. Michael is aided by Janet, a human-esque repository for all of the knowledge in the universe. However, when Michael and Janet begin interfering with the humans' lives, to make sure they wind up in The Good Place, they're going against the Judge's orders and on borrowed time. When The Bad Place gets involved, Michael and Janet must ask themselves, just how far they'll go to keep the humans out of The Bad Place.",

Shawn repeatedly tries to sabotage the experiment, first by sending a demon to impersonate one of the test subjects, and then by having a Bad Janet impersonate Janet. Once these deceptions have been uncovered, the four human test subjects are Chidi himself, Simone, gossip columnist John, and entitled chauvinist Brent. Eleanor and the rest of the team encourage the four to become friends, study ethics together, and improve as people. By the conclusion of the year-long experiment, all but Brent have shown moral improvement, and even Brent shows potential for change at the last minute. The Judge decides that the afterlife system is indeed flawed\u2014but to mend it, all of humanity must be erased from existence.",
