Unfortunately, the arrival of Setanta MacNess thwarts the plan before they can enact it. As Setanta is the wielder of Gae Bolg, Lugh knows that he will not survive a direct confrontation with him, so he fires a magnetically propelled tungsten projectile into the atmosphere and stalls Setanta long enough for it to obliterate him. Afterwards, the Tuatha D\u00e9 family adopts Dia under the guise of being Lugh's younger sister, completing the mission. Sometime later, Lugh receives word that the Hero, Lord Epona Rhiannon, has arrived in the Alvan Kingdom.",
