        "overview": "Ray fears getting his adenoids removed, but Debra convinces him to go through with the surgery.  At the hospital, while Marie is in the bathroom, the nurse says that Ray isn't waking up from the anesthesia and everyone fears he may die.  Fortunately, thirty seconds later, the doctor comes out and says he's just fine.  Everyone agrees not to tell Ray or Marie about it; however, Frank ends up telling Marie who rushes over to smother Ray with kisses.  Ray finds out about it and begins acting weird as if he thinks he really is going to die.  After a couple minutes, he gets out of it.  The show closes with the entire family sitting around the table eating and arguing, just like the Barones always have in the past nine years.",
