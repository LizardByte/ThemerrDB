With an outgoing character, she's the caring Onee-san type, this being one of her greatest strengths.\n\n...But, I already have my first love, the beautiful idol of our school, and the award-winning author, Kachi Shirokusa! Thinking about it rationally, I should have no chances with her, but, while walking home from school, she only talks to me, with a smile even! I might actually have a chance, don't you think?!\n\nOr so I thought, but then I heard that Shirokusa already has a boyfriend, and my life took a turn for the worse. I want to die. Why is it not me?! Even though she was my first love... As I was drowning in despair and depression, Kuroha whispered.\n\n\u2014If it's that tough for you, then how about we get revenge? The best revenge ever, that is~",
