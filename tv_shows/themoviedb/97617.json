However, what awaited him in reincarnation after 2000 years were descendants who became too weak after being accustomed to peace, and all sorts of magic that deteriorated to the extreme. Anos enters Demon King Academy that gathers and educates those who are viewed as the reincarnation of the Demon King, but the academy could not see through his true powers and ends up branding him as a misfit.",

To put an end to this conflict, Demon King Anos Voldigoad willingly sacrificed his life, hoping to be reborn in a peaceful future.\n\nIn preparation for their king's return, the demon race created the Demon King Academy, an elite institution tasked with determining Anos' identity when he reawakens. He reincarnates two millennia later, but to his surprise, he soon learns that the level of magic in the world has drastically waned during his absence. Moreover, when he enrolls at the academy to reclaim his rightful title, he finds out that demonkind remembers him differently. This \"lack\" of common knowledge renders him the academy's outlier\u2014a misfit never before seen in history.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, Anos remains unfazed. As he sets out to uncover those altering his glorious past, he takes it upon himself to make his descendants recognize that their ruler has finally returned.",

However, the spirit world is shrouded in mystery, and it may only be entered after undergoing a series of difficult trials.\n\nWith unrivaled power and confidence, Anos braces himself to defeat various formidable enemies with grandiose titles.
