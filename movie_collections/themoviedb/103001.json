    "overview": "Fant\u00f4mas is a fictional character created by French writers Marcel Allain (1885\u20131969) and Pierre Souvestre (1874\u20131914). One of the most popular characters in the history of French crime fiction, Fant\u00f4mas was created in 1911 and appeared in a total of 32 volumes written by the two collaborators, then a subsequent 11 volumes written by Allain alone after Souvestre's death. A trilogy of Fant\u00f4mas films, which started in 1964 with Fant\u00f4mas, departed considerably from the novels by giving the story a more comedic tone as preceded by the first two Pink Panther films, and by making Fant\u00f4mas (played by Jean Marais) more of a James Bond enemy by likewise borrowing from the first two Bond films.",
