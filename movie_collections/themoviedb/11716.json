    "overview": "The Addams Family started as a Cartoon in 1938. A TV Sitcom ran between 1964 and 1966, and a TV movie with the same cast in 1977. A 1991 American fantasy comedy film directed by Barry Sonnenfeld was followed by a sequel in 1993, with a TV cartoon in the intervening years. A 1998 film was a soft reboot with a different cast, which led to a short-lived live-action TV Sitcom shortly after. A CGI Cartoon Feature Film rebooted the franchise in 2019.",
