    "overview": "A series of films that follow several people playing a strange board game that unleashes all the creatures from the game's jungle into our world. The board game later turns into a video game, and when booted up, the players become the avatars of the characters they have selected. The only way to stop the game is to beat it and call out its name. All films are based on a book written by Chris Van Allsburg in 1981.",
