    "overview": "A series of films based around a 1981 fantasy children's picture book of the same name, written and illustrated by the American author Chris Van Allsburg. They follow the adventures of various people who find themselves imperiled when playing a magic board game called Jumanji that will either trap players within its dangerous jungle world or unleash its menaces into the real world. Ultimately, the only way to end the disruptions is to finish the game while enduring its resulting dangers with each succeeding move, after which everything is restored to normal outside of the players' memories.",
