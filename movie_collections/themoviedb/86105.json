    "overview": "American Psycho is a cult psychological thriller and satirical film. The film focuses on Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman, whose mental instability and bloodlust lead him to serial killing. A direct-to-video spin-off, American Psycho II: All American Girl, was not based on the novel or the original film, as its only connection with the original is the death of Patrick Bateman, briefly shown in a flashback. However, the sequel continues the pattern in the first film of featuring a series of graphic deaths of colleagues and friends of the main character.",
