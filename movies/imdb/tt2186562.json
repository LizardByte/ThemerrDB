    "overview": "Keeping secrets can be difficult, especially when you\u2019re a twelve-year-old half-vampire moving from Transylvania to a new life in Germany. Going to school, making new friends and fitting in \u2014 it\u2019s all tough when you can\u2019t just be yourself. With a vampire father and a human mother, sisters Dakaria (Daka) and Silvania don\u2019t live in your typical blended family. Each girl embraces a different side of her genetic makeup: Daka wishes she was 100% vampire; Silvania wishes she was 100% human; and both believe they can finally realize their hearts\u2019 desires when the opportunity to change presents itself. Will Daka and Silvania realize that, sometimes, your uniqueness is your greatest strength?",
