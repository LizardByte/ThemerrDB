    "overview": "Ebenezer Scrooge is a busy duck when Christmas rolls around. He has to count lots of money in his Counting House. He does have a certain mouse helping him, named Bob Cratchit. And though Bob has a friendly attitude to his miserly boss, he is not duly rewarded for his work and his family doesn't have enough food to go around. Scrooge can't be bothered with other people's misery. That is, until he is visited by three ghosts, who show him the effects of his miserly ways. The other shorts are also related to Christmas, the most religous of which is called \"The Small One,\" which ends with a starlit cross lighting the sky on the eve of Jesus' birth",
