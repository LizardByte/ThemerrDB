    "overview": "Remy, a resident of Paris, possesses a palate far more refined than that of his fellow comrades. He dreams of becoming a chef, determined to create culinary masterpieces rather than scavenge for scraps. There\u2019s just one small problem: Remy is a rat. When fate deposits him in the sewers beneath one of Paris\u2019s most famous restaurants, he finds himself ideally placed to fulfill his dream. Forming an unusual alliance with a bumbling young kitchen worker, Remy begins a daring culinary double life. Together, they must outwit the scheming Head Chef Skinner, evade Remy\u2019s disapproving colony, and impress renowned food critic Anton Ego, who strikes fear in the hearts of chefs all throughout France.",
