But she finds it on the back of an old photo. She sets off for Paris. She stays with her gay dancer pal Marc. Marc and friends decide to go to their favourite gay bar... but it's men only. So Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique becomes Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, an effeminate gay boy... Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique follows her father. Pierre Arroux is an art curator - and gay. She introduces herself to him, but as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric. So while Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric is quite an awkward young man and an embarrassment to his father, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique is secretly meeting with her old boyfriend now living in Paris..",
